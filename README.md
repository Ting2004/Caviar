## About Caviar
The idea of making a Chinese word deliminator comes from the book, *The Beauty of Mathenamatics in Computer Science* by Jun Wu. To deliminate words for a segment in Chinese is the very first step of NLP in Chinese. And I happened to know a little about Markoc Chain and Viterbi Algorithm.

Thanks for Caviar's contribution to my college application.

## Limitations
There are a lot of problems in this project, including but not limiting to
- biasd and outdated corpus
- brute method to create the tree
- dictionary not cleaned, may include numbers which means nothing
- use the simplest Markov model for it, the context is limited to the one segment prior to the segment
